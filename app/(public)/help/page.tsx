        <p>
          Trace is a quotation workflow demonstration. It keeps product
          pricing, customer context, approval decisions and the issued document
          attached to one traceable commercial record.

                compare them with the immutable snapshots on an issued quote.

            <p>
              Money uses integer minor units, percentage rates use basis points,
              and scaled quantities avoid floating-point drift. PostgreSQL is
              authoritative; TypeScript previews are parity tested against it.

            <h3>Captured commercial snapshots</h3>
            <p>
              Submission captures approval conditions. Issuance captures the
              customer and seller identity, preventing later profile edits from
              silently rewriting an issued document.

          <article>
            <h3>Tenant and capability boundaries</h3>
            <p>
              Organization membership, Row Level Security and guarded database
              commands decide who may read or mutate. Hiding a button is not
              treated as authorization.

          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>Append-only activity</h3>
            <p>
              Submission, decisions, issuance and recipient events remain
              attached to the quotation as evidence rather than being replaced
              by only the latest state.

          </article>
          <article>
            <h3>Recipient capability links</h3>
            <p>
              Issuers can create bounded share links. Signed transport, short
              sessions, verification codes and database checks keep recipient
              access separate from employee authentication.

            <h3>Responsive commercial documents</h3>
            <p>
              Tables become readable mobile cards, long legal names wrap, and
              issued documents retain print-oriented presentation without
              changing their amounts.

            <p>
              That is expected for the read-only reviewer. The interface hides
              mutation controls and the database independently refuses those
              capabilities.

            <summary>A quote amount looks surprising</summary>
            <p>
              Check quantity × unit price first, then discount, price basis, tax
              presentation and charges. Line amount never folds document
              discount and tax into quantity × unit price.

              Correct: the home-page specimen is deliberately ephemeral. The
